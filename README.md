# Contact Book

A command-line contact management system in C++.  
Add, view, search, and delete contacts with persistent file storage.

## How to Run

Compile with:
g++ contactBook.cpp -o contactBook
./contactBook


## My Learning Journey

The hardest part was adding file save/load for persistence. 
I solved it by using structs and writing each contact line to a text file.
